# Wireless-NAS-File-Sharing-server
The ESP32 SD Card Server is a standalone wireless file storage system that enables users to upload, browse, and download files through a web interface. This project leverages the ESP32's WiFi capabilities to create an Access Point (AP) mode server, allowing direct file management via a web browser without requiring an external internet connection.
